# UI Testing Playground – Playwright Automation Suite

This repository contains a complete collection of automated tests for the  
**[UI Testing Playground](http://uitestingplayground.com/)** website, implemented using **Playwright** along with a  
Page Object Model (POM) structure. 

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate handling of difficult  
UI automation scenarios, such as unstable elements, dynamic behaviors,  
timing issues, and Shadow DOM interactions.  
Each test corresponds to a specific challenge designed to improve automation skills.

## What this project covers

The suite includes tests for:

- Elements with **dynamic IDs**
- Buttons with **changing or multiple classes**
- **Hidden** and **overlapped** UI layers
- **Load delays** and **client-side delays**
- **AJAX-driven** content
- Elements that **ignore native clicks**
- **Text input** validation
- **Scrollbars** and out-of-viewport interactions
- **Dynamic tables** with unpredictable structure
- **Non-breaking spaces** in text selectors
- **Progress bars** with fast-changing values
- **Visibility** quirks (opacity, visibility, offscreen, display:none, etc.)
- **Mouse Over** events replacing DOM elements
- **Shadow DOM** components
- **JavaScript alerts**
- **File upload** (both drag & drop and browse)
- **Animated buttons** requiring stabilization waits
- Inputs that become **enabled after a delay**
- **Auto-waiting** behavior for elements toggled after actions

## Purpose

This project demonstrates:

- Mastery of Playwright locators
- Handling real-world UI automation edge cases
- Clean and reusable POM architecture
- Correct usage of Playwright auto-waiting
- Techniques to deal with dynamic or flaky UI behaviors

It also serves as a reference for learning Playwright on a deeper level by  
solving all main challenges of the UI Testing Playground website.
